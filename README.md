# Robotic Hand Grip Force Control with PID and 3D Visualization

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a PID controller to regulate the grip force of a robotic hand with five fingers. Each finger is equipped with pressure sensors to measure the applied forces. The goal is to maintain a stable grip on objects, such as a basketball, using dynamically adjusted forces.

## Features

- **PID Control:** Implementation of a PID controller to adjust the grip force of each finger based on sensor feedback.
- **2D and 3D Visualization:** Visualize the grip forces and positions of the fingers holding a basketball using Matplotlib.
- **Simulated Data:** Example with simulated sensor data to demonstrate the functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and open the provided Python scripts.
2. Run the scripts in Google Colab or your local Python environment to see the PID control and visualizations.
3. Modify the sensor data and PID parameters to adapt the control system to your specific needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```
2. Run the Python scripts to see the PID control in action and visualize the results.
